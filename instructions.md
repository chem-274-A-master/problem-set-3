  <strong>Showing your work</strong> 
  <p>
    Your homework assignments should show incremental development with at least two different commits over two different days of work. Assignments that do not show incremental development will incur a 5% penalty.

  <strong>AI Acceptable Use</strong>
  <p>
"AI" refers to Artificial Intelligence and includes tools like ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot, and other language models or AI-powered assistants. AI tools may be used to research ideas or clarify concepts. However, they should not be used to generate code or complete assignments. All submitted work must reflect your own understanding and effort.

Python - Molecules as Graphs
----------------------------
So far in this course, we've talked about running molecular mechanics and quantum chemistry simulations of molecules.
But, how do you store information about molecules in databases?
Or, if you have a set of molecules, how do you determine which molecules are similar to one another?
When you have a large amount of data, visual inspection to determine similarity or equivalence is impractical. 
It also requires high skill and may be prone to errors.
Thus, for cheminformatics or machine learning applications, we have to be able to express a molecule mathematically.

Many of the representations for small molecules that are used in cheminformatics and drug discovery are based on representing molecules using graph theory. There are algorithms and molecular representations that build on top of this concept. 

A mathematical graph is made up of "nodes" or "vertices" (circles in the image below) and "edges" which connect nodes (line between circles in the image below).

</center>

When molecules are represented as graphs, the atoms are represented as nodes in the graph, and the bonds are represented as edges.

In this homework, you will use a Python library called [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) for graph representation.
You will also implement your own ring finding algorithm.
However, if you were working on a real molecular application, you would likely use a specialized library like [RDKit](https://www.rdkit.org/) instead (we will use this library in a later lab!).

Your task for this homework is to use Python to represent molecular information read from a [Structured data File (sdf)](https://chem.libretexts.org/Courses/Intercollegiate_Courses/Cheminformatics/02%3A_Representing_Small_Molecules_on_Computers/2.05%3A_Structural_Data_Files) as a graph. You have been provided with a function called `parse_sdf` in `read.py` which will return a list of elements and bonds from an sdf file.

You will use a Python library called [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) to create a graph from molecular information read from an SDF.
You can then use graph functions to determine things about the molecular structure, such as the presence of rings.

Your code should create a graph using the information from the sdf. 
You should then print out the number of rings in the molecule and the number of atoms in each ring. You should also use NetworkX to create a visualization of the network and save it to a file.

Your code should include:

1. A function called `create_graph` to create a NetworkX graph from the output of `parse_sdf`. Each atom should be a node and each bond should be an edge. The function signature should be
```
def create_graph(nodes: list[tuple], edges: list[tuple]) -> nx.Graph:
```
2. A function called `count_rings` that takes in the graph you created in (1). Your function should calculate the number of rings (cycles) in the molecule and the number of atoms in each ring using NeworkX. You will have to consult the NetworkX documentation to find an appropriate method. You should return your results as a tuple with the first element being the number of rings and the second element being a list of the number of atoms in each ring. The function signature should be
```
def count_rings(graph: nx.Graph) -> tuple[int, list[int]]:
```
3. A function called `visualize_molecule` that takes in an graph created by (1) and **saves** an image. Create a visualization of your molecule with `nx.draw_network`. Label the nodes in the visualization with the atom elements. You should also color the nodes by element using [CPK coloring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPK_coloring).

### Questions
Answer these questions in your `README.md`. 

1. What is an important feature of a NetworkX node? What data type did you choose to represent a node, and why? If you did not include information about the atom identity in your node, what type of Python data type could you have used to do that?
2. For this assignment, you were instructed to complete it by writing functions. How might your code have been different if you chose to use object oriented programming instead? How might you have used inheritance to create your molecule graph object?
2. Use PubChem to get an SDF file for a molecule of choice and use your code to analyze it. What molecule did you choose and why?

### Files
Include the following files in your repo:
1. Your code which can create a NetworkX network from information in an SDF file. Remember that this should be in a file named `molecule_graph.py`.
2. A `README.md` which explains the repo purpose and how to run the code in your project.
3. A `Makefile` with the following targets:
   1. `environment` - creates the Python environment needed to run your code. Note that you will need to create an install libraries you need like NetworkX. Name your environment `problem_set_3` EXACTLY. Match this case exactly or the autograder will not be able to find your environment.
   2. `visualize` - create a visualization of the molecule you chose for (3) and save a png image.
   3. `analyze` - run your code on the molecule you chose for (3) and print out the number of rings and the number of atoms in each ring.
   4. `clean` - remove images from `visualize` or any files created by `analyze`.

C++ - Generic printing function
-------------------------

Write a (templated) function that takes in an std::vector containing any type, and
then loops over it and prints all the contents, with each element of the vector
on its own line.


### Overloading the stream insertion operator

In C++, you can overload the stream insertion operator (`<<`). You can do
this by writing a function that takes in two arguments, one being the output
stream object, and the second argument being what is going to be inserted. In
this case, the first argument is a generic `std::ostream` (output stream)
object, and the second is what you want to print.

We will cover streams in a little more detail in Week 5. However, we will just
say now that `std::cout` is a type of `std::ostream`. Therefore, by overloading
this operator we can say `std::cout << vec`.

The function should return the `std::ostream` object that was passed in. This
is what allows chaining calls to the operator `<<`. Of course, this function
can be templated!


    std::ostream & operator<<(std::ostream & os, ...)
    {
        return os;
    }
